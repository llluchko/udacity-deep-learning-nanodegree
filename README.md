# udacity-deep-learning-nanodegree

This repo includes all the course projects which are part of Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree:
- Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns - using Basic Neural Networks
- Dog-Breed Classifier - using Convolutional Neural Networks
- Generate TV Scripts - using Reccurent Neural Networks
- Generate Faces - using Generative Adversarial Networks
- Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model - using Amazon's SageMaker platform

In every project folder, there is a Jupyter Notebook file with information about the project case, given tasks and requirements by Udacity and the relevant decisions by me.
